 View Name: gold.dim_customers

 Purpose:
 This view creates a customer dimension for the gold layer by combining customer information 
 from both CRM and ERP sources. It consolidates keys, names, demographic data, and origin country 
 into a clean dimensional format suitable for analytical querying.

 Key Features:
   - Generates a surrogate key (`customer_key`) using ROW_NUMBER
   - Merges CRM and ERP customer data on customer key (`cst_key` â†” `cid`)
   - Prioritizes gender from CRM, but falls back on ERP if unknown
   - Provides standardized field names for reporting use

 Source Tables:
   - silver.crm_cust_info (CRM customer master)
   - silver.erp_cust_az12 (ERP customer demographics)
   - silver.erp_loc_a101 (ERP customer location)
